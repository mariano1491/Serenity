# What Is Cellular Aging?

In truth, scientists still aren't exactly sure what causes chronological aging in the body. However, what is understood is that our cells become damaged over time, which leads to an arrest in cell cycle division. When our cells stop dividing, it leads to a progressive deterioration of our organ systems and eventually results in tissue dysfunction (i.e., your organs no longer do what they're supposed to)[*].

While aging is a natural process that everyone experiences, the rate of aging and the amount of cellular damage you experience throughout your life are factors that can be modified with appropriate lifestyle choices. We may not be able to stop aging altogether, but we can certainly slow down the process by mitigating some of the factors that damage our cells.

So, what are those factors? Research shows that two of the most common culprits that come with cellular damage and aging are inflammation and oxidative stress

Inflammation and oxidation are actually quite natural and normal in a healthy body. They arise and resolve as needed, and your body returns to a state of homeostasis. It's only when these two processes get out of control that issues arise.

Now for the real question; how do these processes get out of control?

## Oxidative Stress

Oxidative stress happens when the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) outpaces the antioxidant defense systems in your body. When ROS and antioxidants are in balance, oxidation occurs, and your antioxidants come in to calm it down. When ROS outpace antioxidants, they can continue to proliferate and damage your cells, leading to cellular aging[*].

## Inflammation

Your inflammatory process is a vital aspect of your immunity. Without proper inflammatory activity, you would never heal from injury or be able to fight off an infection. However, when inflammation becomes chronic and doesn't resolve, it can be too much of a good thing. Chronic inflammation leads to tissue damage and is at the root of some of the most common diseases we see today, including diabetes, heart disease, and arthritis[*].

## Nutrition and Cellular Health

At this point, you're probably wondering where food comes into the picture. Simply put, the foods you choose to consume can either promote inflammation and oxidative stress in your body or provide nourishment to your cells to combat these processes. As previously mentioned, the food you eat becomes the material that makes up your cells, tissues, and organs. Therefore, nourishing foods will create nourished cells.
